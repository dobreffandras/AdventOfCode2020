# AdventOfCode2020

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. It is organized by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) and the challenge takes place every year from 1st of Dec until Christmas. I suggest you try it out next time.

For 2020 I decided to practice F# (the functional programming language for .NET). It was a great fun.
